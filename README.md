# Cocktail Web App

A simple web app made from just JavaScript, HTML and CSS (bootstrap framework).
The javascript makes calls to an API that returns over 1000s cocktail details and instructions on how to make them.
Made to practice Javascript, including Async and Fetch.

What as been done so far:
- [x] index.html & bootstrap css
- [x] connect to API - using Async and Fetch
- [x] search cocktails and have them display their details
- [x] cycle through cocktails with the same name to see different recipes
- [x] return a random cocktail
- [ ] edit CSS to look nicer
- [ ] add more functionality - filtering by alcohol type
